# Review_of_Stock_prediction_models
Review of various algorithms for predicting the performance of stock. BERT, ARIMA, LSTM, Knowledge Graphs.

**DATASET DETAILS:**
1) Historical data of different companies in nifty50 (Kaggle)
2) Data for sentiment analysis scraped from twitter and google news (refer scraping code)

**Algorithms**
1) Sentiment Analysis of the texts scrapped using BERT (pre-trained model). Test accuracy of 80%

2) ARIMA and LSTM on the historical stock price dataset. The LSTM model outperforms ARIMA when compared using RMSE values.
